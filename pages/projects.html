              participation of Politecnico di Milano, the Italian Space Agency
              (ASI) and the Vietnam National Space Center (VNSC). It aims to
              replicate and expand the methodologies developed in the project
              LCZ-ODC and to test them, in a comparative manner, on cities in
              Italy and Vietnam. The selected cities are Milan and Rome in
              Italy, and Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. The bilateral
              collaboration will enable the study of diverse urban climatic
              contexts. Leveraging the integration of various areas of
              expertise, the project will advance research on the correlation
              between LCZ maps and temperature maps generated from in situ and
              satellite data.

              each main area at 30m resolution every five years from 1990 to the

              Multi-dimensional models of urban areas across time and countries
              will be used to support urban planners in exploring natural
              occurrences of similar development ideas, concepts, or projects in

              <br \ />
              The LCZ maps will be identified using a combination of high
              spectral and spatial resolution satellite imagery, including
              PRISMA hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, as well
              as regional geospatial data provided by local authorities.
              <br \ />
              As part of the project, interactive and innovative applications
              will be developed to enhance the accessibility of the LCZ maps and
              enable national users to effectively utilize the project's
              products. The project outcomes will be presented to users through
              workshops and events, which will provide an opportunity to collect
              feedback and consolidate requirements for the developed
              applications.

              systematic integration of non-conventional data, with a focus on
              satellite-based PM estimates, into traditional PM monitoring
              frameworks based on fixed ground sensors. Data ingestion to

              advantage of data science techniques through the combination of
              machine-learning and geostatistical models. The final ambition is
              to foster debate and awareness among regional policymakers,
              farming operators, and citizens on both technical and
              non-technical aspects for co-creating best evidence-based

              phenomenon which is relevant in both Italy and Vietnam. The goal
              is to join efforts and experience in the field of geodata science,
              focusing on the most innovative approaches. Where the partners
              will design and implement sustainable new observation processing
              strategies. As such to study and apply new techniques for
              landslide detection and monitoring through earth observation data,
              machine learning algorithms and citizen science .The project will
              have an important consequence also in building new capacities,
              which will be transferred into the universities’ teachings and
              professional refresher training, with a direct impact on students
              and an indirect influence on technology transfer outside the
              academic environment.

              in the field of Higher Education 2019.The main aim of CIDMA is to
              build education capacity to improve disaster management in
              Mozambique, using geospatial information technology. It focuses on
              spatial data and methods, using digital maps, satellite data, and
              spatial modelling, in order to foresee and prepare for risks
              related to possible disasters linked to a changing climate. The
              objectives are to develop up-to-date courses in disaster
              management; train partner members on how to develop and teach the
              courses; implement the developed courses at the partner
              universities in Mozambique; improve quality in education and
              teaching; improve infra-structure at the partner universities in
              Mozambique; develop and implement a Disaster Management Tool;
              disseminate outputs and outcomes, and to develop Higher
              Educational Institutions within society. The consortium is
              composed of eight partner institutions from – Sweden, Portugal,
              Italy and Mozambique. GEOLab is responsible for developing the
              “Public Participatory GIS and Spatial Data Infrastructure in
              Disaster Management” course.

              and Amazonia are the three regions selected for mapping. The
              outputs of the project are multiple: static land cover for each
              selected region at 10m spatial resolution for year 2018,
              historical land cover map for selected subregion in each main
              region at 30m resolution for every 5 years starting from 1990
              until present date, and land cover change maps for specific land
              cover change at 30m spatial resolution on a yearly scale. GEOLab
              is part of Validation team and carries out inter-comparison of the
              project outputs with existing land cover maps.

              decision-making processes, and therefore the socio-economic

              will be enriched with geospatial components considering the
              integration of datasets.
