                Maria Antonia Brovelli is a distinguished academic and
                researcher specializing in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
                and Earth Observation. With a background in Physics and a Ph.D.
                in Geodesy and Cartography, she has dedicated her career to
                Politecnico di Milano (PoliMI), where she is a Professor of GIS,
                Earth Observation, and The Copernicus Green Revolution for
                Sustainable Development. She previously served as Vice-Rector
                for the Como Campus.
                <br />
                <br />
                Her contributions extend beyond academia through leadership
                roles in international organizations. She is Vice President of
                the ISPRS Technical Commission on Spatial Information Science
                and co-chair of the United Nations Open GIS Initiative. She has
                also contributed to ESA’s Advisory Committee on Earth
                Observation and chaired the UN-GGIM Academic Network from 2020
                to 2024.
                <br />
                <br />
                Her research spans geodesy, radar altimetry, GIS, webGIS,
                Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), Citizen Science, Big
                Geo Data, and GEOAI. As a global leader in Open-Source GIS, she
                has an extensive publication record and has been involved in
                numerous national and international research projects. Recent
                projects include collaborations under Horizon2020, Interreg, and
                Erasmus+, along with initiatives involving ESA.
                <br />
                <br />
                Brovelli's work has earned her prestigious recognitions,
                including the ISPRS President's Honorary Citation in 2020 and
                the Sol Katz Award from OSGeo in 2015. She also holds editorial
                roles in leading academic journals, further solidifying her

                Stefano Conversi was born in Viterbo, Italy, in 1997. He
                obtained both his BSc degree in Civil and Environmental
                Engineering and MSc honours degree in Civil Engineering for Risk
                Mitigation at Politecnico di Milano. His MSc thesis was centered
                on the design of a WebGIS platform to support seismic crisis
                management in a dam-populated area. Since February 2022 he is
                part of the Geolab team as PhD student, in collaboration with
                Mi-Pore! research group, within the context of Progetto
                Innovazione promoted by Regione Lombardia. Currently, he is
                working with the regional General Direction for the Climate and
                the Environment, in the development of a project for the
                detection and prioritization of areas affected by the presence
                of alien invasive vegetation, aiming to preserve regional
                biodiversity. His main fields of interest are the ones of crisis
                management and geoprocessing techniques to support risk
                assessment.

                Nikolina Zallemi was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1999. She
                obtained her B.Sc. in Geodetic Engineering at the Polytechnic
                University of Tirana, in 2021. She started the M.Sc. in
                Geoinformatics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, in 2021 and
                received the title in July 2024 with a thesis in Advancement in
                Precise Point Positioning by GNSS and LEO integration. In
                September 2024, she started a PhD in Environmental and Hydraulic
                Engineering and Geomatics. Her research interests are focused in
                the field of Positioning, specifically in processing phase
                observations using LEO constellations.

                Is a GIS and Remote Sensing specialist with over 15 years’
                experience working in the geospatial field. She completed a BSc
                degree in Environmental Conservation and Natural Resource
                Management at the University of Nairobi, Kenya and an MSc degree
                in GIS and Remote Sensing from the Jomo Kenyatta University of
                Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Kenya in the year 2023. Her
                interests revolve around generation, analysis and interpretation
                of Earth Observation data to inform decisions and reporting on
                Forest & Landcover mapping; Forest Reference Level (FRL) and
                REDD+ processes; Green House Gas inventory (GHGI) for the Forest
                and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector; Early warning systems and
                Climate change – Mitigation and Adaptation. Most recently she
                co-ordinated the FOLU sector team in data analysis to inform
                GHGI reporting under the Biennial Transparency Reporting (BTR)
                for UNFCCC. During her operations she noticed a challenge of
                accurate mapping of forests found within the dryland areas using
                satellite data. Her PhD research is therefore focusing on how to
                integrate Earth Observation datasets to monitor dryland forest
                dynamics.

                algorithms in citizen science projects with the goal of
                improving data quality and sustaining participation. Since April
                2022, she is a postdoctoral researcher at HEIG-VD. Her areas of
                interest in research include volunteered geographic information
                (VGI), citizen science, spatial data analysis, spatial
                statistics, and satellite image analysis. She has worked on a
                number of projects including the development of geospatial
                applications as well as the statistical analysis of geospatial
                data using free and open-source software.
